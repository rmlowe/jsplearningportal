# Sample JSP e-learning portal based on the NetDimensions SDK

A sample e-learning portal site based on the [NetDimensions SDK](http://www.netdimensions.com/solutions/learning-portals.php).
Created using JavaServer Pages (JSP).

To configure delegated authentication you will need to rename the file named `config-example.jsp` to `config.jsp`, and then
edit the values of the variables listed below.

* `authKey` should have the same value as the `authentication.key` property defined in `/WEB-INF/conf/ekp.properties`.
* Create a user in Talent Suite with the **Switch User** permission (probably a System Administrator) and configure
  `adminUserName` and `adminPassword` as, respectively, the user ID and password of that user. (This is the user that the JSP site will authenticate as when calling the API.)

You will also need to make the following changes to `signin.jsp`.

* `callback` should be the absolute URL of the file `authcallback.jsp` on your server.
* The base redirect URL needs to be changed to reference your Talent Suite installationâ€”for example
  `http://utest2.netdimensions.com/utest/` might be changed to `https://www.example.com/ekp/`.

You will also need to add the host name or IP address of the JSP site to the list **Trusted relying parties for delegated
authentication**, which is under the **Users** category of **Manage** > **System Administration** > **System Settings** >
**System Configuration**. (The value configured here must exactly match the host portion of the `callback` value configured
above.)

If you want to use a custom login page template for the portal (that is, different from the generic login page template for
the Talent Suite site), place the login page template under the `/WEB-INF/conf/` directory and add the value `host:template`
under **Trusted relying parties for delegated authentication**, where `host` is the host name or IP address of the JSP site
and `template` is the file name of the custom login page template. Example: `www.example.com:myTemplate.wm`

Delegated authentication is explained in more detail in the
[documentation](https://wiki.netdimensions.com/confluence/display/ptk/Delegated+authentication).
